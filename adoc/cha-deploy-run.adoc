==== Pod deployment with Podman

Apart from being able to build images, Podman (see [[podman]]) also has a container deployment engine, which can be used for easier pod deployment. This engine works with the concept of pods - a group of one or more containers that operate together. Pods can also be thought of as a way to group related containers together for easier management. Because Podman deploys each container as its own process, this can be a very efficient and easy way of creating interconnected containers.
