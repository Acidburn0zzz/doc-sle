 <abstract>
  <para>Add-on products are system extensions. They can either be free extensions based on
   &productname; (such as <xref linkend="sec.add-ons.sdk" xrefstyle="select:title no page"/>, or
   additional products requiring a registration key that is liable to costs (such as the &sle;
   &hasi;, for example). They can either be available on physical media or as repositories only
   that are available for you after registering your system at &scc; or a local registration
   server. </para>
  <para>Some add-on products are also provided by third parties, for example, binary-only drivers
   that are needed by certain hardware to function properly.</para>
  <para>If you have such hardware, refer to the release notes for more information about
   availability of binary drivers for your system. The release notes are available from <ulink
    url="https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/"/>, from &yast; or from
    <filename>/usr/share/doc/release-notes/</filename> in your installed system.</para>

  <para>&sdk; &productnumber; is an add-on for &sle; &productnumber;. It is a
   complete tool kit for application development. In fact, to provide a comprehensive build system,
   &sdk; &productnumber; includes all the open source tools that were used to build the
   &sls; product. It provides you - as a developer, independent software vendor (ISV), or
   independent hardware vendor (IHV) - with all the tools needed to port applications to all the
   platforms supported by &sled; and &sls;. </para>
  
  <para>
   &sdk; also contains integrated development environments (IDEs),
   debuggers, code editors, and other related tools. It supports most major
   programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and most scripting
   languages. For your convenience, &sdk; includes multiple Perl packages
   that are not included in &sle;.

  <title>Installing Add-Ons and Extensions</title>
  <para>A list of available add-on products and extensions is available after having registered your
   system at &scc; or a local registration server. If you skipped the registration step during
   the installation, you can register your system at any time using the <guimenu>&scc;
   Configuration</guimenu> module in &yast;.</para>
  <note>
   <title>Available Extensions and Modules</title>
   <para> The amount of available extensions and modules depends on the registration server. A local
    registration server may only offer update repositories and no additional extensions at all.
   </para>
  </note>
  <tip>
   <title>&sled;</title>
   <para> As of &sle; 12, &sled; is not only available as a separate product, but also as an
    extension for &sls;. If you register at the &scc;, the &sled; extension can be
    selected for installation. Note that installing it requires a valid registration key. </para>
