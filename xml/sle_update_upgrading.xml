    <abstract>
      <para> &slereg; (&slea;) allows to update an existing system to
        the new version, for example, going from &slea; 11 SP4 to &slea;
        12. No new installation is needed. Existing data, such as home
        and data directories and system configuration, is kept intact.
        You can update from a local CD or DVD drive or from a central
        network installation source. </para>
