  &gnome; is an easy-to-use graphical interface that can be customized to meet
  your needs and personal preferences.

 <title>Included Session Configurations</title>
  <para>
   <!-- Does this need profiling for SLE? - sknorr, 2015-09-10 -->
   Some versions of &sle; ship with as many as three different
   session configurations based on &gnome;. These are &gnome;, &gnome; Classic,
   and &slea; Classic.
   The version described here is the default configuration of &sled;
   called &slea; Classic.

  <title>Logging In</title>
  <para>
   In general, all users must authenticate&mdash;unless
   <guimenu>Auto Login</guimenu> is enabled for a specific user.
   In this case, a particular user will be logged in automatically when the
   system starts.
   This can save some time, especially if a computer is used by a single person.
   It may impact account security.
   Auto Login can be enabled or disabled during installation or at any time
   using the &yast; User and Group Management module.
   For more information, refer to <xref linkend="cha.y2.userman"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If your computer is running in a
   network environment and you are not the only person using the machine,
   you are usually prompted to enter your user name and password when you
   start the system.

        If you move the mouse pointer over one of the icons, GNOME will

        A light glow indicates that the application is running and has at least
        one open window.

       <para>
        Right-clicking an icon opens a menu which offers

        Using <guimenu>Add to Favorites</guimenu>, you can place the
        application icon permanently in Dash.
