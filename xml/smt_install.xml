 <title>&smt; Installation</title>
 <remark>jsrain: Rewrite this chapter completely.
THere is no add-on, packages are part of SLES.
To configure SMT after installation, inform user to first create a server certificate (sure this is documented somewhere) and then run the yast smt-server module.</remark>
 <para>
  &smt; is an add-on product for &sls; 11 systems. You can either install
  the &smt; add-on together with your &sls; base system during the initial
  installation process, or on top of an already-installed base system at any
  later time. &smt; can be obtained free of charge from
  <link xlink:href="https://download.suse.com/"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you install &smt; on top of SLES with the latest maintenance patches
  applied, you may get dependency errors in some cases if you do not also
  use the latest &smt; patches. To avoid those dependency errors, re-run
  Novell Customer Center (&ncc;) Configuration in &yast; right after you
  have added the &smt; installation repository to your system, but before
  you install any packages from &smt;. This way the &smt; update repository
  will be properly available to your system.
 </para>
 <para>
  It is recommended to to check for &smt; updates available immediately
  after installing the product. SUSE continuously releases maintenance
  updates for &smt;, and newer packages are likely to be available compared
  to those installed from media, for example using the <command>zypper
  patch</command> command.
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>Installation Scope</title>
  <para>
   SMT is a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) based application. During the
   installation, Apache and MySQL will automatically be installed if
   missing.

    <para>
     &smt; now registers against &scc; instead of Novell Customer Center.
     Therefore you need to switch the registration center on &sls; 11 before
     upgrading to &sls; 12. You can switch to &scc; either via a &yast;
     module or command-line tools.
    </para>
    <para>
     Before performing the switch between customer centers, make sure that
     the target customer center serves all products that are registered
     against &smt;. Both &yast; and the command-line tools perform a check
     to find out whether all products can be served with the new
     registration server.

    <para>
     To perform the migration to &scc; via command-line, use:
    </para>
<screen>smt ncc-scc-migration</screen>
    <para>
     The migration itself is time-consuming and during the migration process
     the &smt; server may not be able to serve clients that are already
     registered.
    </para>
    <para>
     The migration process itself changes the registration server and the
     proper type of API in the configuration files. No further
     (configuration) changes are needed on the &smt;.
    </para>
    <para>
     To migrate from &ncc; to &scc; via &yast;, use the &yast; smt-server
     module.
    </para>
    <para>
     After migration is done, it is needed to re-synchronize &smt; with the

     up-to-date. This can be done using the following commands:
