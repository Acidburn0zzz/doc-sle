   &vmguest;s (virtual machines), virtual storage and networks can be
   managed with &libvirt;-based and &qemu; tools. &libvirt; is a library
   that provides an API to manage &vmguest;s based on different
   virtualization solutions, among them &kvm; and &xen;. It offers a
   graphical user interface as well as a command line program. The &qemu;
   tools are &kvm;/&qemu; specific and are only available for the command
   line.

  <title>&kvm; Virtualization Architecture</title>
  <para>
   This full virtualization solution consists of two main components: A set of Kernel
   modules<phrase
   condition="kvm4x86"> (<systemitem>kvm.ko</systemitem>,
   <systemitem>kvm-intel.ko</systemitem>, and
   <systemitem>kvm-amd.ko</systemitem>)</phrase> providing the core
   virtualization infrastructure and processor specific drivers and a
   userspace program (<systemitem class="resource">qemu-system-ARCH</systemitem>)
   that provides emulation for virtual devices and control mechanisms to
   manage &vmguest;s (virtual machines). The term &kvm; more properly refers
   to the Kernel level virtualization functionality, but is in practice more
   commonly used to reference the userspace component.

  <title>The <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package</title>

  <para>
   The <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package provides
   <command>qemu-kvm</command>, the program that performs the I/O emulation
   for the &vmguest;. In addition to the qemu-kvm program, the
   <systemitem
   class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package also comes with
   a debug level monitoring utility (<command>kvm_stat</command>), firmware
   components, key-mapping files, and scripts.
   <phrase condition="kvm4x86">The deprecated Windows drivers
   (<filename>win-virtio-drivers.iso</filename>) are no longer provided. For
   more information, see
   <xref
   linkend="kvm.deprecated.features"/>.</phrase>
  </para>

  <para>
   Originally, the <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package
   also provided the &kvm; Kernel modules. Now, these modules are included
   with the Kernel and only userspace components are included in the current
   <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package.

   Support for creating and manipulating file-based virtual disk images is
   provided by <command>qemu-img</command>. <command>qemu-img</command> is
   provided by the package
   <systemitem class="resource">qemu-tools</systemitem>.
