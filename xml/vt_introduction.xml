   Guest operating systems are hosted on virtual machines in either full                                 
   virtualization mode or paravirtual mode. Each virtualization mode has                                 
   advantages and disadvantages.

     Full virtualization mode lets virtual machines run unmodified operating                             
     systems, such as Windows* Server 2003, but requires the                              
     computer running as the &vmhost; to support hardware-assisted                                       
     virtualization technology, such as AMD* Virtualization or Intel*                                    
     Virtualization Technology.

     Some guest operating systems hosted in full virtualization mode, can be                             
     configured to run the Novell* Virtual Machine Drivers instead of                                    
     drivers originating from the operating system. Running virtual machine                              
     drivers improves performance dramatically on guest operating systems,                               
     such as Windows Server 2003. For more information, see

     Paravirtual mode does not require the host computer to support                                      
     hardware-assisted virtualization technology, but does require the guest                             
     operating system to be modified for the virtualization environment.                                 
     Typically, operating systems running in paravirtual mode enjoy better                               
     performance than those requiring full virtualization mode.
