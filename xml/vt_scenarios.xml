  <abstract>
   <para>
    Virtualization design provides several useful capabilities to your
    organization: more efficient hardware use, support for legacy software,
    operating system isolation, live migrations, disaster recovery, and 
    load balancing.

  <title>Server Consolidation</title>
  <para>
   Many servers can be replaced by one big physical
   server, so hardware is consolidated, and guest operating systems are
   converted to virtual machines. This also supports running legacy
   software on new hardware.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Isolation</title>
  <para>
   A guest operating system can be fully isolated from the host
   running it. If the virtual machine is corrupted, the host system is
   not harmed.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Migration</title>
  <para>
   Migration is a process to move a running virtual machine to another
   physical machine. Live migration is an extended feature that allows
   this move without disconnection of the client or the application.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Disaster Recovery</title>
  <para>
   <xref linkend="gloss-vt-virtualized"/> guests are less dependent on the 
   physical hardware. The host server supports making snapshots
   of the virtual machines, enabling restoration to a known good state,
   or to any desired earlier state.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Dynamic Load Balancing</title>
  <para>
   A migration feature that provides a simple way to
   load-balance your service across your infrastructure.
  </para>
