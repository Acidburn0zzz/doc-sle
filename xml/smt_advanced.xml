 <para>
  This chapter introduces topics that will give you more control over your
  &smt; server, but are beyond the usual workflow.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="smt.backup">
  <title>Backup of the &smt; Server</title>

  <para>
   Creating backups of the &smt; server regularly can help restore it quickly
   and reliably in the case of the server failure.
  </para>

  <para>
   There are three main areas to back up on the &smt; server:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Configuration files
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Package repositories
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The database
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <sect2 xml:id="smt.backup.conf_files">
   <title>Configuration Files and Repositories</title>
   <para>
    The &smt; server configuration is stored in the
    <filename>/etc/smt.conf</filename> file and files in the
    <filename>/etc/smt.d</filename> directory.
   </para>
   <para>
    As &smt; depends in the services provided by the Apache Web server and
    MariaDB database engine, you need to back up their configuration files as
    well. Apache's configuration files are located in the
    <filename>/etc/apache2</filename> directory, while the configuration files
    for MariaDB are <filename>/etc/my.cnf</filename>,
    <filename>/etc/mysqlaccess.conf</filename>, and files in the
    <filename>/etc/my.cnf.d</filename> directory.
   </para>
   <para>
    Package repositories are stored in the
    <filename>/srv/www/htdocs/repo</filename> directory. Although you can
    normally mirror the repositories on the restored server from the update
    server as well, the download can take a long time. Therefore backing the
    repositories saves you time and bandwidth. On the other hand, backing up
    the repositories is necessary if you are using repository staging (see
    <xref linkend="smt.staging"/>).
   </para>
   <warning>
    <title>Size of the Repositories</title>
    <para>
     The size of the software repositories can be huge and you will need to
     transfer them from the update server.
    </para>
   </warning>
   <para>
    Use your preferred tool to back up the configuration and repository files.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="smt.backup.db">
   <title>The Database</title>
   <para>
    &smt; uses the MariaDB database to store information about clients,
    registrations, machine data, which catalogs are enabled for mirroring, or
    custom catalogs. Unlike the configuration files and repositories, the
    database information cannot be recovered without a valid backup.
   </para>
   <para>
    To back up the &smt; database, you can for example create a cron job that
    performs an SQL dump into a plain text file:
   </para>
<screen>mysqldump -u root -p <replaceable>smt_db_password</replaceable> smt > /<replaceable>backup_dir</replaceable>/smt-db-backup.sql</screen>
   <para>
    Then include the resulting file to your normal backup jobs.
   </para>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="smt.disconnected">
  <title>Disconnected &smt; Servers</title>

  <para>
   In some restricted environments it is not possible for &smt; servers to
   access the Internet because they are located in disconnected or isolated
   networks. By using some special parameters on the &smt; commands and a
   mobile disk, it is possible to accommodate for this.
  </para>

  <para>
   You need to have one external &smt; server that mirrors the repositories
   from &scc;. Then you can 'mirror' these repositories to the &smt; servers on
   the isolated network using the mobile storage medium.
  </para>

  </figure>

  <para>
   Although the initial setup of this solution requires additional
   configuration, the regular update synchronization with &scc; and
   distribution to isolated servers is simple. The steps required during the
   initial setup consist of:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Installation and configuration of the external &smt; server.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Installation of the internal server.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Modification of <filename>/etc/smt.conf</filename> and cron setup on the
     internal &smt; server.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>

     of the normal MariaDB database when performing the mirror jobs) on the

  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     On the external server run the <command>smt-mirror</command> job based on
     the database replacement file that writes to the mobile disk.
    </para>

  <para>
   A detailed description of the individual steps follow:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <title>External &smt; Server Configuration for the Disconnected Setup</title>
   <step>
    <para>
     Install and configure &smt; as described in
     <xref linkend="smt.installation"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Enable the repositories to be consumed by the internal &smt; servers.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Perform a normal repository mirroring from &scc; with
     <command>smt-mirror</command>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Attach a removable disk to the server and mount it.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Export the required &scc; data to a directory on the mounted removable
     disk:
    </para>
    <substeps>
     <step>
      <para>
       Create the directory with proper permissions to hold the data. Because
       the <command>smt</command> commands run as the
       <systemitem class="username">smt</systemitem> user (whose numeric UID
       can differ between the servers), we need to ease up the permissions for
       the directories on the mobile disk:
      </para>
<screen>chmod o+w <replaceable>/path/to/scc/dir/on/mobile/disk</replaceable></screen>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Export the &scc; data:
      </para>
<screen>smt-sync --todir <replaceable>/path/to/scc/dir/on/mobile/disk</replaceable></screen>
     </step>
    </substeps>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Set up a directory with proper permissions:
    </para>
<screen>mkdir <replaceable>/path/to/repository/on/mobile/disk</replaceable>
chmod o+w <replaceable>/path/to/repository/on/mobile/disk</replaceable></screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Unmount and detach the removable disk.
    </para>
   </step>
