 <title>Confining Users with <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem></title>
 <para>
  An &aa; profile applies to an executable program; if a portion of the
  program needs different access permissions than other portions need, the
  program can change hats via change_hat to a different role, also known as
  a subprofile. The <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> PAM module allows
  applications to confine authenticated users into subprofiles based on
  group names, user names, or a default profile. To accomplish this,
  <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> needs to be registered as a PAM
  session module.
