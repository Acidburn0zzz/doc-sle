 <title><command>journalctl</command>: Query the &systemd; Journal</title>
 <para>
  When &systemd; replaced traditional init scripts in &sle; 12 (see
  <xref linkend="cha.systemd"/>, it introduced its own logging system called
  <emphasis>journal</emphasis>. There is no need to run a
  <systemitem>syslog</systemitem> based service anymore, as all system
  events are written in the journal.
 </para>
 <para>
  The journal itself is a system service managed by &systemd;. Its full name
  is <literal>systemd-journald.service</literal>. It collects and stores
  logging data by maintaining structured indexed journals based on logging
  information received from the kernel, from user processes, from standard
  input and error of system services. The
  <literal>systemd-journald.service</literal> service is on by default:

 <para>
  The journal stores log data in <filename>/run/log/journal/</filename> by
  default. Because the <filename>/run/</filename> directory is temporary by
  nature, log data is lost at reboot. To make the log data persistent, the
  directory <filename>/var/log/journal/</filename> must exist where the
  systemd-journald service stores its data.
