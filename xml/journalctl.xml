 <title><command>journalctl</command>: Query the &systemd; Journal</title>
 <para>
 When &systemd; replaced traditional init scripts (&sle;
 version 12), it introduced its own logging system called
 <emphasis>journal</emphasis>. There is no need to run a
 <systemitem>syslog</systemitem> based service anymore, as system events are
 recorded in the journal.
