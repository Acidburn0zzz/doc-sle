      <abstract>
        <para>
    The GNOME desktop includes assistive technologies to support users with
    various impairments and special needs, and to interact with common
    assistive devices. This chapter describes several assistive technology
    applications designed to meet the needs of users with physical
    disabilities like low vision or impaired motor skills.

  <title>Enabling Assistive Technologies</title>

  <para>
   To configure accessibility features, open the GNOME Settings dialog (for
   example using <menuchoice> <guimenu>Applications</guimenu>
   <guimenu>System Tools</guimenu> <guimenu>Settings</guimenu></menuchoice>)
   and click <guimenu>Universal Access</guimenu>. Each assistive feature is
   enabled separately using this dialog.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you need a more direct access to individual assistive features, check
   <guimenu>Always Show Universal Access Menu</guimenu> in the
   <guimenu>Universal Access</guimenu> dialog. A new menu will appear on the
   bottom panel.
  </para>

  <title>Visual Impairments</title>

  <para>
   In the <guimenu>Visual Impairments</guimenu> section of the
   <guimenu>Universal Access</guimenu> dialog, you can enable features that
   help people with impaired vision.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turning <guimenu>High Contrast</guimenu> on enables high contrast black
   and white icons in the GNOME desktop.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turning <guimenu>Large Text</guimenu> on enlarges the font used in the
   user interface.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turning <guimenu>Zoom</guimenu> on enables a screen magnifier. You can
   set the desired magnification and magnifier behavior, including color
   effects.
<!--FIXME-->
  </para>

  <para>
   If the <guimenu>Screen Reader</guimenu> is turned on, any text under the
   cursor (as you move it) is read aloud.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the <guimenu>Sound Keys</guimenu> are turned on, a sound is played
   whenever Num Lock or Caps Lock are turned on.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.general.accessibility.hearing">
  <title>Hearing Impairments</title>

  <para>
   In the <guimenu>Hearing Impairments</guimenu> section of the
   <guimenu>Universal Access</guimenu> dialog, you can enable features
   helping people with impaired hearing.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the <guimenu>Visual Alerts</guimenu> are turned on, a window title or
   the entire screen is flashed when an alert sound occurs.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.general.accessibility.mobility">
  <title>Mobility Impairments</title>

  <para>
   In the <guimenu>Typing</guimenu> and <guimenu>Pointing and
   Clicking</guimenu> sections of the <guimenu>Universal Access</guimenu>
   dialog, you can enable features that help people with mobility
   impairments.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the <guimenu>Screen Keyboard</guimenu> is turned on, a virtual
   keyboard appears whenever you need to enter text. You can use the screen
   keyboard by clicking the virtual keys.
  </para>

  <para>
   Click <guimenu>Typing Assist</guimenu> to open a dialog where you can
   enable various features that make typing easier: sticky keys, slow keys
   and bounce keys. You can turn these features on individually.
  </para>

  <para>
   <guimenu>Sticky Keys</guimenu> allows you to type key combinations one
   key at a time rather than having to hold down all of the keys at once.
   For example, the <keycombo>
   <keycap function="alt"/><keycap function="tab"/></keycombo> shortcut
   switches between windows. Without sticky keys turned on, you have to hold
   down both keys at the same time. With sticky keys turned on, press
   <keycap function="alt"/> and then <keycap function="tab"/> to do the
   same.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turn on <guimenu>Slow Keys</guimenu> if you want a delay between pressing
   a key and the letter being displayed on the screen. This means that you
   need to hold down each key you want to type for a little while before it
   appears. Use slow keys if you accidentally press several keys at a time
   when you type, or if you find it difficult to press the right key on the
   keyboard first time.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turn on <guimenu>Bounce Keys</guimenu> to ignore key presses that are
   rapidly repeated. For example, if you have hand tremors which cause you
   to press a key multiple times when you only want to press it once, you
   should turn on bounce keys.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turn on <guimenu>Mouse Keys</guimenu> to control the mouse pointer using
   the numeric keypad on your keyboard.
  </para>

  <para>
   Click <guimenu>Click Assist</guimenu> to open a dialog where you can
   enable various features that make clicking easier: simulated secondary
   click and hover click.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turn on <guimenu>Simulated Secondary Click</guimenu> to activate the
   secondary click (usually the right mouse button) by holding down the
   primary button for a predefined <guimenu>Acceptance delay</guimenu>. This
   is useful if you find it difficult to move your fingers individually on
   one hand, or if your pointing device only has a single button.
  </para>

  <para>
   Turn on <guimenu>Hover Click</guimenu> to trigger a click by hovering
   your mouse pointer over an object on the screen. This is useful if you
   find it difficult to move the mouse and click at the same time. If this
   feature is turned on, a small Hover Click window opens and stays above
   all of your other windows. You can use this to choose what sort of click
   should happen when you hover. When you hover your mouse pointer over a
   button and don't move it, the pointer gradually changes color. When it
   has fully changed color, the button will be clicked.
