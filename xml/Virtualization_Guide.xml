  <title>Disk Interface Cache Modes</title>

  <para>
   Hypervisors allow for various storage caching
   strategies to be specified when configuring a VM Guest. Each guest disk
   interface can have one of the following cache modes specified:
   <emphasis>writethrough</emphasis>, <emphasis>writeback</emphasis>,
   <emphasis>none</emphasis>, <emphasis>directsync</emphasis>, or
   <emphasis>unsafe</emphasis>. If no cache mode is specified,
   an appropriate default cache
   mode is used. These cache modes influence how host-based storage is accessed, as
   follows:

     Read/write data may be cached in the host page cache.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The guest's storage controller is informed whether a write cache is
     present, allowing for the use of a flush command.

    <para>
     Synchronous write mode may be used, in which write requests are
     reported complete only when committed to the storage device.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Flush commands (generated by the guest storage controller) may be
     ignored for performance reasons.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   If a disorderly disconnection between the guest and its storage occurs, the
   cache mode in use will affect whether data loss occurs. The cache mode can
   also affect disk performance significantly. Additionally, some cache modes
   are incompatible with live migration, depending on several
   factors. There are no simple rules about what combination of cache mode,
   disk image format, image placement, or storage sub-system is best. The user
   should plan each guest's configuration carefully and experiment with
   various configurations to determine the optimal performance.

    <term>cache mode unspecified</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      In older QEMU versions, not specifying a cache mode meant that
      <emphasis>writethrough</emphasis> would be used as the default. With
      modern versions—as shipped with <phrase role="productname"><phrase os="osuse">openSUSE Leap</phrase><phrase os="sles">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase><phrase os="sled">SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop</phrase></phrase>—the various
      guest storage interfaces have been fixed to handle
      <emphasis>writeback</emphasis> or <emphasis>writethrough</emphasis>
      semantics more correctly. This allows for the default caching mode to be
      switched to <emphasis>writeback</emphasis>. The guest driver for each of
      <literal>ide</literal>, <literal>scsi</literal>, and
      <literal>virtio</literal> have within their power to disable the write
      back cache, causing the caching mode used to revert to
      <emphasis>writethrough</emphasis>. The typical guest's storage drivers
      will maintain the default caching mode as <emphasis>writeback</emphasis>,
      however.

   <varlistentry xml:id="cache-writethrough">

    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode causes the hypervisor to interact with the disk image file or
      block device with <literal>O_DSYNC</literal> semantics. Writes are reported
      as completed only when the data has been committed
      to the storage device. The host page cache is used in what can be
      termed a writethrough caching mode. The guest's virtual storage
      adapter is informed that there is no writeback cache, so the guest
      would not need to send down flush commands to manage data integrity.
      The storage behaves as if there is a writethrough cache.

   <varlistentry xml:id="cache-writeback">

     <para>
      This mode causes the hypervisor to interact with the disk image file or
      block device with neither <literal>O_DSYNC</literal> nor
      <literal>O_DIRECT</literal> semantics. The host page cache is used and
      writes are reported to the guest as completed when they are placed in the
      host page cache. The
      normal page cache management will handle commitment to the storage
      device. Additionally, the guest's virtual storage adapter is informed
      of the writeback cache, so the guest would be expected to send down
      flush commands as needed to manage data integrity. Analogous to a raid
      controller with RAM cache.

    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry xml:id="cache-none">
    <term>none</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode causes the hypervisor to interact with
      the disk image file or block device with
      <literal>O_DIRECT</literal> semantics. The host page cache is bypassed
      and I/O happens directly between the hypervisor user space buffers and the
      storage
      device. Because the actual storage device may report a write as
      completed when placed in its write queue only, the guest's virtual
      storage adapter is informed that there is a writeback cache. The
      guest would be expected to send down flush commands as needed to
      manage data integrity. Performance-wise, it is equivalent to direct
      access to your host's disk.

   <varlistentry xml:id="cache-unsafe">
    <term>unsafe</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode is similar to the <literal>writeback</literal> mode
      discussed above. The key aspect of this <quote>unsafe</quote> mode, is
      that all flush commands from the guests are ignored. Using this mode
      implies that the user has accepted the trade-off of performance over
      risk of data loss in case of a host failure. Useful, for example,
      during guest installation, but not for production workloads.

   <varlistentry xml:id="cache-directsync">
    <term>directsync</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode causes the hypervisor to interact with the disk image file or
      block device with both <literal>O_DSYNC</literal> and
      <literal>O_DIRECT</literal> semantics. This means, writes are reported as
      completed only when the data has been committed to the storage device,
      and when it is also desirable to bypass the host page cache. Like
      <xref linkend="cache-writethrough"/>, it is helpful to guests that do
      not send flushes when needed. It was the last cache mode added,
      completing the possible combinations of caching and direct access
      semantics.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      These are the safest modes, and considered equally safe, given that
      the guest operating system is <quote>modern and well behaved</quote>,
      which means that it uses flushes as needed. If you have a suspect
      guest, use <emphasis>writethough</emphasis>, or
      <emphasis>directsync</emphasis>. Note that some file systems are not
      compatible with <literal>none</literal> or
      <literal>directsync</literal>, as they do not support O_DIRECT,
      which these cache modes rely on.

   <varlistentry>
    <term>writeback</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode informs the guest of the presence of a write cache, and
      relies on the guest to send flush commands as needed to maintain data
      integrity within its disk image. This is a common storage design which
      is completely accounted for within modern file systems. This mode exposes
      the guest to data loss in the unlikely case of a host failure,
      because there is a window of time between the time a
      write is reported as completed, and that write being committed to the
      storage device.

    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>unsafe</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode is similar to <emphasis>writeback</emphasis> caching except for
      the following: the guest flush
      commands are ignored, nullifying the data integrity control of these
      flush commands, and resulting in a higher risk of data loss because of
      host failure. The name <quote>unsafe</quote> should serve as a warning
      that there is a much higher potential for data loss because of a host
      failure than with the other modes. As the guest terminates,
      the cached data is flushed at that time.

 <section xml:id="qemu-cachemodes-performance">
  <title>Performance Implications of Cache Modes</title>

  <para>
   The choice to make full use of the page cache, or to write through it, or
   to bypass it altogether can have dramatic performance implications. Other
   factors that influence disk performance include the capabilities of the
   actual storage system, what disk image format is used, the potential size
   of the page cache and the IO scheduler used. Additionally, not flushing
   the write cache increases performance, but with risk, as noted above. As
   a general rule, high-end systems typically perform best with the cache mode
   <literal>none</literal>, because of the reduced data copying that
   occurs. The potential benefit of having multiple guests share the common
   host page cache, the ratio of reads to writes, and the use of AIO mode
   <literal>native</literal> (see below) should also be considered.

 <section xml:id="sec-cache-mode-live-migration">
  <title>Effect of Cache Modes on Live Migration</title>

  <para>
   The caching of storage data and metadata restricts the configurations
   that support live migration. Currently, only <literal>raw</literal> and
   <literal>qcow2</literal> image formats can be used for live migration. If a
   clustered file system is used, all cache modes support live migration.
   Otherwise the only cache mode that supports live migration on read/write
   shared storage is <literal>none</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The <systemitem class="library">libvirt</systemitem> management layer includes checks for
   migration compatibility based on several factors. If the guest
   storage is hosted on a clustered file system, is read-only or is marked
   shareable, then the cache mode is ignored when determining if migration
   can be allowed. Otherwise <systemitem class="library">libvirt</systemitem> will not allow
   migration unless the cache mode is set to <literal>none</literal>.
   However, this restriction can be overridden with the
   <quote>unsafe</quote> option to the migration APIs, which is also
   supported by <command>virsh</command>, as for example in
  </para>

<screen><prompt>tux &gt; </prompt>virsh migrate --live --unsafe</screen>

  <tip>
   <para>
    The cache mode <literal>none</literal> is required for the AIO mode setting
    <literal>native</literal>. If another cache mode is used, then the
    AIO mode will silently be switched back to the default <literal>threads</literal>. The
    guest flush within the host is implemented using
    <systemitem>fdatasync()</systemitem>.
