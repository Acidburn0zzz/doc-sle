CD Creator is an old name to the current tool named Product Creator.

Product Creator is the tool for 
a) creating new products to the installable form (directory with correct 
product metadata, or iso image which you could burn to DVD and install from 
it)
b) use such configuration to create kiwi-based images (USB stick image, live 
CD iso etc.)

The configuration in part b can be reused from part a, that's why it is all in 
one tool called Product Creator.
On the other hand, the part b could work independently, as a 
front-end for kiwi, so this part can be started stand-alone and is called 
Image Creator.

To make it more interesting, we also have the module called Add-On creator, 
which is used for creating Add-On products (similar to e.g. Language Add-On 
for openSUSE or SDK for SLE).

 <title>Creating Images with &yast; &productcreator;</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   The &yast; &productcreator; is a unified graphical front-end for &kiwi;
   and &addoncreator;. It was developed to provide image creation
   functionality in one place. All tools integrated in the &yast;
   &productcreator; are also available as separate &yast; modules or
   applications.
  </para>
  <para>
   To be able to use the &productcreator; you need to install the package
   <systemitem class="resource">yast2-product-creator</systemitem> from the
   &sdk;. The SDK is an add-on product for &sle; and is available for download
   from <ulink url="https://download.suse.com/"/>. Search for <literal>&sle;
   Software Development Kit</literal>.

  <title>Creating Images</title>

  <para>
   The &productcreator; uses &kiwi; to create an image of a product. In case
   you are interested in manually developing such images, refer to
   <ulink url="http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   To create an image of a product, proceed as follows:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Start &yast; and open the <guimenu>Product Creator</guimenu> module.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     If you are starting the &productcreator; for the first time, enter the
     configuration name and choose the method for adding packages to the ISO
     image.
    </para>
    <para>
     In case you have already created a product, the window shows a list of
     all existing products. You may <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> or
     <guimenu>Delete</guimenu> them. Choose <guimenu>Add</guimenu> to create a new
     one.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Select or deselect package sources to be used within the product by
     selecting an entry and choosing <guimenu>Select</guimenu> or
     <guimenu>Remove</guimenu>, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
     Choose <guimenu>Create New</guimenu> to start the &yast; &addoncreator;
     for setting up a new software source. Once finished, start the &yast;
     <guimenu>Installation Sources</guimenu> module and add the source you
     just created. Restart the &productcreator; to make the source available
     for selection.
    </para>
    <para>Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.</para>
    <note>
     <title>Unsupported Target Architectures</title>
     <para>
      Do not change the target architecture. As of &productname; 12 &kiwi;
      does not support building of different architectures.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Select the base source from the list of repositories chosen in the
     previous step. If the resulting iso image should be bootable, it must
     contain a <filename>/boot</filename> directory containing files needed to
     boot the system.
    </para>
    <para>Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Enter the path in which to create the skeleton directory in the
     <guimenu>Product Creator Configuration</guimenu> screen. Choose
     whether to generate an ISO file or a directory tree.
    </para>
    <para>
     Activating <guimenu>Copy only needed files</guimenu> saves
     space. Optionally enter credits by specifying the <guimenu>CD
     Publisher</guimenu> and the <guimenu>CD Preparer</guimenu>.
    </para>
    <para>Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Edit the content of the <filename>isolinux.cfg</filename> file, if it
     is a part of the configuration. In most cases you can leave it as it
     is. If the file is not part of the configuration, add it now with
     <guimenu>Load File</guimenu>.
    </para>
    <para>Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Select the software packages to be included in the product. The default
     view lets you select patterns. Choose <guimenu>Details</guimenu> to be
     able to select individual packages. The solver tries to solve all package
     dependencies automatically whenever you select new packages. In case it
     fails, you need to manually resolve the conflict. If a conflict cannot be
     solved, a source providing a needed package may be missing. 
    </para>
    <para>Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Sign your product with <guimenu>Digitally Sign the Product on the
     Medium</guimenu>, if needed. Provide a key for your product
     configuration. Signing your product with your &gpg; key provides
     evidence of the origin of your product.
    </para>
    <para>Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.</para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check your settings in the configuration summary and proceed with

     change a setting.

   Your product definition is now completed. The &productcreator; allows you
   to choose from the following actions:

      Creates an ISO image of the selected product. If there is something
      missing, the process will be aborted. Correct the error and repeat the
      configuration.
