     <remark>taroth 2014-06-06: TODO - this text is no longer up to date
     (http://www.suse.com/support features an entry "Open a Service Request" but
     this only leads to an (also outdated) document on
     https://www.suse.com/support/handbook/#q7) - according to SCC guys, opening
     SRs is not implemented yet, check with fhassels next week</remark>
